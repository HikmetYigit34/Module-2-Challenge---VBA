This is my solution to VBA Challenge

I have created 2 functions. 
First one is looping throgh sheets and activating them one by one, then calling the second function each time.
Second one is calculating results for activated sheet.

For full functionality please run first function only.

Second function can be nested in the first one and all can be one function, 
but I thought this way is more descriptive and each activated(selected) sheet can run seperately for diagnostics.
